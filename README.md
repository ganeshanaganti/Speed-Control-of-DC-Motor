# DC Motor Speed Control Monitoring System

This repository contains the code for a DC Motor Speed Control Monitoring System. The system uses an Arduino to control and monitor the speed of a DC motor, sending real-time data to a ThingSpeak channel. A web dashboard is provided to visualize the motor's duty cycle, voltage, speed, and state using different types of charts.

## Features
- Real-time data fetching from ThingSpeak
- Visual representation of duty cycle, voltage, speed, and motor state
- Responsive design with two cards per row

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Modify the JavaScript to include your own ThingSpeak API key and channel ID.
